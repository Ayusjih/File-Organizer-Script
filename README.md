# File-Organizer-Script
This Python automation script organizes cluttered directories by grouping files into subfolders based on their file extensions (e.g., moving all `.jpg` files into a `JPG` folder). It improves file management efficiency and demonstrates automation skills using Python's `os` and `shutil` modules.
